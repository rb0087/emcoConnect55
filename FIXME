Changes/fixes to be made to PCB
-Ground unterminated leads for signal to spindle control board
-Use a cat6 jack for rj45
-Fix mounting hole spacing so that it's a regular grid, not upper right at 4.225 and bottom right at 4.2
-Move ESS 1 and ESS 2 labels further from pins so that they aren't hidden under connector
-Verify the type of RJ45 jack so that the pins actually line up with the one purchased
-Probably use 820ohm or similar instead of 750 ohm because 24V is actually 28. 
-Flip 5V connector
-Flip x111
-more clearance between x114 and coolant
